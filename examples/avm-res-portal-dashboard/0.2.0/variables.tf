For example, use [\"properties.lenses\"] to let users rearrange dashboard tiles in the Azure portal without Terraform reverting them.\n\nPaths use body-relative dot notation. Individual list indices cannot be targeted; ignore the whole property instead. While a path is ignored, configuration changes at that path are **not** sent to Azure until the path is removed from the list.\n\nSupplying a **non-empty** value requires Terraform 1.11 or later, because ignore_body_changes is a write-only argument held in provider-private state; changes take effect only after an apply. Leaving the list empty (the default) emits no argument, so the module remains usable on earlier Terraform versions.\n"
